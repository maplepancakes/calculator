### Future Considerations
1. Add keyboard support
2. Add continuous user input into secondary display

### Bugs (fix these!!!)
1. Inputting '0' at the end after the addition of a decimal point and clicking on the '+' operator causes the '0' in the display to disappear
2. Dividing by zero does not display 'Infinite'. Instead, it displays the last user input
3. Filling the entire display with only '5' and clicking an operator causes the appearance of '.06' in the display
